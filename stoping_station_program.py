#Stopping station problem

# There are 12 intermediate stations between two places A and B. 
# Find the number of ways in which a train can be made to stop at 
# 4 of these intermediate stations so that no two stopping stations are consecutive?

# Examples â€“
# Test Case - 1


# Input  : n = 12, s = 4
# Output : 126

# Test Case - 2 

# Input  : n = 16, s = 5
# Output : 792
